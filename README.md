- **Dwarves** - Pragmatic industrialists who exploit natural resources
- **Monster Tribes** - Various groups including orcs, goblins, kobolds, lizardmen, and minotaurs

Each faction has unique strengths, weaknesses, and diplomatic considerations that will shape your strategy.

## 🧟‍♂️ Minion System

Summon and command two primary minion races:

- **Humanoids** (Goblins, Kobolds) - More accepted, versatile roles

Minions evolve over time, gaining new abilities based on their assigned roles.

## 🏆 Game Loop

Every turn consists of four key phases:

1. **Dungeon Management** - Expand and fortify your domain
2. **Event & Interaction** - Engage with characters and story developments
3. **Faction Negotiations** - Establish alliances or prepare for conflict
4. **Combat & Defense** - Defend against raids in tactical turn-based combat

## 🔮 Inspiration

IDM draws from classic Japanese isekai narratives and turn-based dungeon management games, offering a unique fusion of storytelling depth with tactical gameplay complexity.
